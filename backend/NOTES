- all time handling within the backend (and possibly DB) should be using ints.
  Only stringify on frontend

- What is threading (see backend/books.py) used for? Are we spawning a new
  thread for a timera?

- I thought about splitting book to sellable and borrowable subclasses but that
  might not be a good idea as the state of each book object can change 
  (and a book can be BOTH sellable and borrowable).

- ASSUME ALL DATA ENTERING BACKEND TO BE VALID:
  all inwards validation will be at the API endpoint.
  all logic checking and correctness, however, will still be the backend's business.




TODO:

- Review wesam's code
- Finish Books code
- Rearrange classes and introduce inheritance

- create a release 0.1, merge it into master, delete rc and develop

- start work on flask and state.py
