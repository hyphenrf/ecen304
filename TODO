TODO:

- [x] Create a class structure specification
- [?] Implement Book, User, Admin, Author classes
	- [?] Admin
	- [?] Author
	- [?] Book
	- [] user

- TIP: Defining datastructures in python is possible using Classes.
			 Since Python 3.7, this is made way easier now:

			 from dataclasses import dataclass

			 @dataclass
			 class Struct:
			 		name: str
			 		value: int
					# etc...
